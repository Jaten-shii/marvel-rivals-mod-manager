# Test pnpm Execution Methods - Windows Compatibility

## üéâ **Clean State Recovery: SUCCESSFUL!**

Your `pnpm install` worked perfectly:
- ‚úÖ 658 packages installed cleanly
- ‚úÖ Pure pnpm state (no mixed package managers)
- ‚úÖ Build process completed successfully
- ‚úÖ `cross-env 7.0.3` is installed

## üîç **Current Issue**: `pnpm exec` Command Syntax

The error suggests `pnpm exec` has argument parsing issues on Windows. Let's test alternative methods:

## **Test Battery** (Run each command and report results)

### Test 1: Package.json Scripts (Should Work)
```cmd
pnpm run dev
```
**Expected**: Should start development server successfully  
**Why**: Uses package.json scripts (postinstall worked, so this should work)

### Test 2: pnpm dlx (pnpm's npx equivalent)
```cmd
pnpm dlx cross-env --version
```
**Expected**: Should show version without errors

### Test 3: pnpm exec with explicit separator
```cmd
pnpm exec -- cross-env --version
```
**Expected**: May fix argument parsing issue

### Test 4: Verify npx still works (fallback)
```cmd
npx cross-env --version
```
**Expected**: Should work (postinstall used npx successfully)

### Test 5: Direct binary access
```cmd
.\node_modules\.bin\cross-env --version
```
**Expected**: Direct access should work

### Test 6: pnpm run with custom script
First, let's test if we can add a simple test script to package.json:
```cmd
# This is just to verify - don't actually edit yet
# We'll use existing scripts first
```

## **Priority Testing Order**

1. **First try**: `pnpm run dev` (most likely to work)
2. **If that works**: Development server is ready!
3. **If that fails**: Try other methods to diagnose further

## **Expected Outcome**

Since your postinstall scripts worked perfectly and used `npx` commands, the binaries are definitely accessible. We just need to find the right pnpm execution method for Windows.

**Most likely**: `pnpm run dev` will work and start your development server successfully.

## **What This Tells Us**

‚úÖ **Clean state recovery**: Complete success  
‚úÖ **Dependencies**: Properly installed  
‚úÖ **Build system**: Working correctly  
üîç **Execution method**: Need Windows-compatible pnpm syntax

## **Next Step**

Run `pnpm run dev` and let me know the result!

If it works, your development environment is fully functional and we can update the batch scripts accordingly.
