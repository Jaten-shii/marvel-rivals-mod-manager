# Test Pure pnpm Workflow - Backend Reliability Approach

## The Problem
Mixing pnpm (installation) + npm/npx (execution) creates system instability:
- Lock file conflicts
- Binary resolution issues  
- Dependency tree corruption
- Execution environment inconsistency

## Pure pnpm Solution

### Test 1: pnpm run (Package.json scripts)
```cmd
cd "C:\Users\James Watson\Desktop\Gaming Stuff\Marvel Rivals Mod Manager"

# Test running the dev script through pnpm
pnpm run dev
```
**Expected**: Should execute the package.json "dev" script using pnpm's environment

### Test 2: pnpm exec (Direct command execution)
```cmd
# Test executing cross-env directly through pnpm
pnpm exec cross-env --version

# Test the full development command
pnpm exec cross-env NODE_ENV=development electron-vite dev --watch
```
**Expected**: Should execute commands in pnpm's binary environment

### Test 3: pnpm dlx (pnpm's npx equivalent)
```cmd
# Test pnpm's npx-like functionality
pnpm dlx cross-env --version
pnpm dlx electron-vite --version
```
**Expected**: Should work like npx but within pnpm's ecosystem

## If Tests Fail

### Solution A: Update package.json scripts
Replace all `npx` commands with `pnpm exec` or `pnpm dlx` to maintain consistency.

### Solution B: pnpm configuration
Configure pnpm to use Windows-compatible shell execution.

### Solution C: Clean mixed state
```cmd
# Remove npm artifacts
del package-lock.json

# Reinstall with pure pnpm
pnpm install --force
```

## Backend Reliability Benefits

✅ **Single source of truth**: Only pnpm-lock.yaml  
✅ **Consistent binary resolution**: All through pnpm  
✅ **Predictable dependency tree**: No mixed hoisting  
✅ **Reproducible environments**: Pure pnpm state  

## Next Steps

Based on test results, we'll implement the pure pnpm approach that works reliably on Windows.
